        Define a promise
            Promise Conceptually 
        A promise is an object that represents a task that will be completed in the future
    
        Analogy: Taking an number at a government office before you can get helped. The piece of paper you get is slike your promise.
        The help you get at the counter is like the invocation of you callback.
       
        Add a .then callback to a promise
        resolve promise - resolve invocated
        
        Add a .catch callback to a promise
        reject promise - and error handling invocated
        
        Wrap a setTimeout call in a promise
